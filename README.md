# Lab-Employees

<p><strong># Description</strong><br />The system keeps track of all the employees in the company.</p>
<p><br /><strong># Following tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the main menu where the user can select the following options. <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;a) Add a new&nbsp;person <br />&nbsp; &nbsp;b) View a list of employees.</li>
<li>When a user selects option a, they will then be brought to a section of the program<br />where they can enter the details for a new employee to be added into the system.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When the user details are being added, a new Person object should be created and<br />stored on an employee vector.</li>
<li>If the user decides to select the second option, option b), they will then be brought to a<br />section of the program where they can select from the following options:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;■ List employees by ID in ascending order<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;■ List of employees by ID in descending order<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;■ Print out the details of an employee based upon a name entered by the administrator.</li>
<li>The bubble sort algorithm should be used during this process to aid the process of searching.</li>
<li>Each of the employees should be added to the system using the specific object type that is<br />designated to them. IT employees must be added to an ITPerson object, and a business person&nbsp;should be added to a BusinessPerson object. Both of these should inherit from the Person&nbsp;object which will store the person's age and their ID number.</li>
</ul>
